NOTES:
    I used separate PHP files for when distinct database queries are called. This is to aid in a separation of concerns, much like the separate CSS files. HTML and PHP were largely kept separate too.

    All information from the database is dynamically queried, none of it is hard-coded.

    All of the resources I used can be found below. The two primary sources I used were practicals and W3schools.

    To begin, open index.php.

    I adapted these resources in my code:
